## SECTION B

### Introduction
> The general area covered by this project is Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence since we will be using a chatbot interacting with a human user. Sentiment Analysis will be used also so the chatbot can interpret the reviews for products and decide if they are positive/negative/neutral. Instant messaging for communication between user and chatbot.

### Outline
> Our proposed project is a web-based chatbot for online stores (we will focus on Amazon for this project). The chatbot will use sentiment analysis to format the reviews of products in a clear and understandable way such as a bar chart/pie chart, letting the user know how many reviews are positive, negative, or just neutral. The user will also be able to request product information as well as being provided a link to the product so they can purchase it if they so desire in the end.

### Background
> The idea came from wanting to experiment with sentiment analysis. We had a professor give a lecture on it before and it seemed very interesting so we decided we wanted to try and apply it to something that we would use. We thought a chatbot would be a fun and interesting way of doing this.

### Achievements
> The project will provide a quick and clear way to see others customers' feelings towards products that the user may want to purchase. The user can be anyone who is looking to purchase a product online and wants to do just a little research beforehand. The chatbot will allow users to ask the chatbot questions to find out about various products from online stores without having to go on the website, search product and then read through long descriptions of the product. The chatbot will also gather reviews of the product and display results on a bar chart showing positive, neutral and negative reviews.

### Justification
> Online shopping is huge in this day and age especially on a site like Amazon. Reviews are a huge part of deciding what to buy online because you can’t get the item in your hands until it’s already bought and delivered so reading up on what others think about it is crucial. Reviews can often be misleading however as a 4-star review can still have plenty of negatives in it as is the case for a 3-star review with a number of positives. So our sentiment analysis will allow the user to see exactly how much of the reviews are positive/negative and save them reading the sometimes thousands of reviews a product may have.

### Programming language(s)
>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java

### Programming tools / Tech stack
> We will be using APIs so we can access product information for different online stores. We will need a web server to host the website that the chatbot will be on.

### Hardware
> N/A

### Learning Challenges
> Neither of us have developed a chatbot before so this will be the main learning challenge from this project. We have used all the programming languages we are planning to use but haven't really covered much of JavaScript so we will need to practice using this before starting the implementation of the project. 

>Another Learning challenge will be ensuring that the chatbot understands the different ways that the user can ask questions. There are a variety of ways that a user could ask the same question so it is important that the chatbot will be able to handle this.


### Breakdown of work
#### Student 1(Jaime Kirk)
> I will be designing the webpage that the chatbot will be displayed on. This will involve using HTML and CSS which I'm quite familiar with but I'll have to do a bit of practice using JavaScript before we start because I haven't used that as much and need to get used to using it again. We will work on developing the chatbot together where we will both work on certain parts and bring what we have been working on together and test to ensure everything works together.

#### Student 2 (Adam Herd)
> For my portion I will work on implementing the Amazon API into the project so we can access all the product info as well as the reviews to be used later in the sentiment analysis portion. I will work alongside my partner to integrate the sentiment analysis as we anticipate it being quite complex for one just one person to handle.
