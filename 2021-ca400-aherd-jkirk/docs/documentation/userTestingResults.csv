04/05/2021 11:16:14,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,In between,Products listing was clear. Easy to find products.,I found the bot confusing at first. This was mostly due to my phone capitalising commands. After I used lower case it was easy enough to use.,Yes,No,"The sentiment analysis was always 98.64% regardless of the product. Even for one with an average rating of 2.5.

Being only able to do sentiment analysis on products with low number of reviews is not ideal. I know this is because of the API but perhaps it could still be optimised.

The UI could probably be more user friendly. Optimizing for mobile devices would also be good.",6

No indication of progress when entering a command. Not sure what was happening when i entered sentiment analysis.",Yes,No,"Commands should just be 1 word instead of sentences. Like 'what is the price' should probably just be 'price' but then explain the command better in the help section.

Sentiment analysis should be explained without using 'sentiment analysis' in the help explanation.

Amazon links should be clickable.",8
